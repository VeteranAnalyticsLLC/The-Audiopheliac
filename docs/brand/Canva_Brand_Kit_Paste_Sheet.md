## Brand Fonts

Set in Canva Brand Kit > Fonts:

| Slot | Font | Use |
|---|---|---|
| Headings (H1) | **Unica One** | Hero, page titles |
| Headings (H2/H3) | **Unica One** | Section headers |
| Body | **Inter** | Body, captions, all running text |
| Other (mono, if available) | **JetBrains Mono** | Hex codes, technical notation |

Unica One and Inter are both Google Fonts. They should be available in Canva natively. If JetBrains Mono is not available, fall back to any monospace face.

## Logo

Already uploaded by Gill 2026-05-12.

**Canonical mark file:** `assets/The_Audiopheliac_Primary_Logo_GPT.jpg`
**Use as:** Primary logo for all templates.
**Treatment notes:** Place on Ink field (`#0A0A0B`) for default appearance. Do not recolor. Do not crop. Do not place on Paper field (loses contrast on cream background — needs a darker container).

---

## Brand Voice (paste into Canva Brand Kit > Brand Voice if available)

**Tone in one line:** Signal and emotion, stated as data. Direct, technically precise, anti-pretense, anti-snake-oil.

**Audience:** Adult middle-class DIY-creative audio enthusiast, not a credentialed audiophile reviewer. Wants the most from affordable gear and available technology. Family-context realistic.

**Two voice registers:**
- **Manifesto** — long-form, slow, declarative. For About narrative, design philosophy, gear deep-dives.
- **Direct** — short sentences, real opinions stated as fact. For content curation, microcopy, social, error states, Cockpit UI.

**Preferred vocabulary:** signal, signal chain, fidelity, groove, body, home hi-fi (lowercase), lived-in, The Audiopheliac presents...

**Forbidden vocabulary:** innovative, disruption, premium, luxury, curated for you, lo-fi (as aesthetic), audiophile (applied to ourselves).

**Style rules:**
- No em dashes in direct register.
- Sentence case for headings, never Title Case or ALL CAPS in body.
- Oxford comma.
- Active voice default.
- No emoji in body copy.

**Motto:** "Rock 'n' roll. Deal with it." (after Bret Easton Ellis).

## CTA Contract

Default CTA appearance for Canva templates:

- Background: `#F8E91F` (Sunlamp Yellow)
- Text: `#0A0A0B` (Ink)
- Hover lift (if interactive template): `#C24CC8` (Magenta Lift) background, `#F5F5F7` (Paper) text
- Border radius: pill (999px) or rounded (12px)
- Font: Inter, 600 weight
- Letter-spacing: 0.04em

**Forbidden CTA color:** `#0ABED3` (Cyan Pulse). Hard rule. Cyan is body-accent only.

## Hero Gradient

Reserved for one or two hero moments per surface. Full spectrum sweep:

```
linear-gradient(90deg,
  #F8E91F 0%,
  #99E257 16%,
  #41D99A 32%,
  #0ABED3 48%,
  #0F82DF 64%,
  #5E54D4 80%,
  #C24CC8 100%)
```

In Canva: build as a custom gradient on a hero element. Apply to text via "apply as text fill" if the template supports it.

## Workflow note

Canva MCP is not currently connected to this session, so I can't push these values directly into the kit. Two-step process:

1. Open the Canva brand kit at `kAHGkHrcJYU` in your browser.
2. Paste from this sheet into the corresponding fields (colors, fonts, voice).
3. Pin the reference PDF inside the kit as a quick-reference card.

When the Canva MCP is connected in a future session, the kit can be populated programmatically.
