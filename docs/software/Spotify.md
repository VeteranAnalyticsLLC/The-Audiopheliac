> Per-package configuration profile for The Audiopheliac. Source of truth for Spotify desktop client, Developer App registration, bit-perfect playback chain through the M-Audio AIR Hub, Local Files indexing into the music library at `M:\The Audiopheliac\`, and the automation pipeline that pulls library state into `data/spotify/`. Cross-references to canonical inventory at `docs/av_master_inventory_2026.md` and to the live signal map at `config/audiopheliac_signal_map_v_2026_05.md`.

## 1. Overview

Spotify is the primary streaming source on GDMARCHE. The desktop client streams from the workstation to two destinations: the Office Studio monitoring chain via the M-Audio AIR Hub (currently locked bit-perfect to Spotify's lossless tier), and the Family Room Yamaha R-N800A via MusicCast / DLNA / Spotify Connect. Local Files functionality indexes the album-output library at `M:\The Audiopheliac\First Tracks\` for MP3 playback alongside streamed content. A Spotify Developer App registration drives the project's `automation/spotify_pull.py` library export and the gap-report pipeline against the on-disk FLAC index.

## 4. Configuration

### 4.1 Spotify desktop client - Audio Quality

| Setting path | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Settings > Audio Quality > Streaming Quality | Lossless | Spotify Premier lossless tier, 16-bit / 44.1 kHz FLAC |
| Settings > Audio Quality > Download Quality | Lossless | Match streaming tier for parity offline |
| Settings > Audio Quality > Auto Adjust Quality | Off | Prevent quality drops on transient network blips |
| Settings > Audio Quality > Normalize Volume | Off | Bit-perfect output requires no volume processing |
| Settings > Audio Quality > Loudness Setting | N/A (Normalize Off) | Disabled with Normalize Off |

### 4.2 Spotify desktop client - Playback

| Setting path | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Settings > Playback > Autoplay | On (personal preference) | Continues queue after user content ends |
| Settings > Playback > Crossfade | Off | Crossfade introduces sample-rate processing that breaks bit-perfect |
| Settings > Playback > Gapless Playback | On | Required for properly mastered albums |

### 4.3 Spotify desktop client - Local Files

| Setting path | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Settings > Library > Show Local Files | On | Enables Local Files source |
| Settings > Library > Show songs from > `M:\The Audiopheliac` | On | Album-output library root; M: maps to `\\NAS87828E\Music` |
| Spotify indexes | MP3 only (WAVs not indexed, vendor format limitation) | Suno bounces saved as WAV + MP3 side-by-side under `M:\The Audiopheliac\First Tracks\` |

### 4.4 M-Audio AIR Hub - Windows Sound properties

| Setting path | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Control Panel > Sound > AIR Hub > Properties > Advanced > Default Format | 16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality) | Matches Spotify lossless source rate; zero resampling in Windows shared mixer |
| Control Panel > Sound > AIR Hub > Properties > Advanced > Exclusive Mode > Allow applications to take exclusive control | Unchecked | Spotify uses WDM shared mode; leaving exclusive disabled prevents other apps from forcing rate changes mid-session |
| Control Panel > Sound > AIR Hub > Properties > Enhancements > Disable all enhancements | Checked | Any DSP enhancement breaks bit-perfect |

### 4.5 M-Audio AIR Hub Driver Control Panel

| Setting | Value | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| Sample Rate | 44100 | Matches Windows default format and Spotify lossless source |
| Preferred Buffer Size | 256 samples (~5.8 ms one-way latency at 44.1 kHz) | Comfortable playback default. AIR Hub has no ADC, so live monitoring latency is irrelevant. Move to 512 or 1024 if dropouts appear under CPU load. |
| Bit depth setting | Not exposed | AIR Hub DAC runs at 24-bit natively. 16-bit Spotify stream is word-extended to 24-bit with zero-padded LSBs by the driver, which is mathematically lossless. |
| Driver version (last verified) | 1.0.5 | Confirmed 2026-05-11. |

## 5. Signal Chain / Integration Points

### 5.1 Bit-perfect playback chain (Office Studio)

```
Spotify desktop client (Lossless tier, 16-bit / 44.1 kHz FLAC)
  > Windows WDM shared mixer (16/44.1, no resampling, no enhancements)
  > M-Audio AIR Hub WDM driver (44.1 kHz, 256-sample buffer)
  > AIR Hub 24-bit DAC (16 bits in upper word, zero-padded LSBs)
  > AIR Hub balanced 1/4" TRS L/R out
  > Rolls MX28 Mini-Mix VI Input A
  > Rolls MX28 Master Out (TRS balanced)
  > JBL LSR310S Subwoofer (TRS in)
  > Yamaha HS7 L/R (TRS balanced out)

Headphone monitoring path:
AIR Hub 1/4" Headphone Out (independent level control)
  > Audio-Technica ATH-M50x
```

### 5.2 Spotify Connect / MusicCast (Family Room)

Spotify Connect targets the Yamaha R-N800A directly. The Yamaha registers itself as a Spotify Connect endpoint on the LAN at 192.168.1.191. Streaming from any Spotify client (desktop, mobile, web) can hand off playback to the R-N800A natively, which then drives the Polk ES60 towers and SVS SB-1000 Pro subwoofer.

Cross-reference: `docs/av_master_inventory_2026.md` Section "Family Room" for the full Yamaha chain.

### 5.3 Data pipeline (this repo)

```
Spotify Web API
  > automation/spotify_pull.py
  > data/spotify/spotify_library.json
  > automation/spotify_local_match.py (joined with data/library_index/library_index.json from music_indexer.py)
  > data/manifests/spotify_local_matches.json
  > automation/spotify_gap_report.py
  > data/manifests/spotify_missing_tracks.txt
```

Pipeline driver auth credentials live in `config/spotify.env` (gitignored).

## 6. Related Automation

| Artifact | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| Spotify lossless bit-perfect wrapper | `C:\Scripts\Set-AIRHub-And-Launch-Spotify.ps1` | Pins AIR Hub default format to 16-bit / 44.1 kHz via NirSoft SoundVolumeView, then launches Spotify. Runs every session to defeat driver auto-renegotiation. |
| Start menu shortcut | `C:\Users\gillo\AppData\Roaming\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Spotify_Bit_Perfect.lnk` | Target: `powershell.exe -NoProfile -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -WindowStyle Hidden -File "C:\Scripts\Set-AIRHub-And-Launch-Spotify.ps1"`. Icon: `%USERPROFILE%\Icons\Spotify_Script.ico`. |
| Format-pin utility | `C:\Tools\SoundVolumeView\SoundVolumeView.exe` | NirSoft portable executable. Source: https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/sound_volume_view.html |
| Library export | `automation/spotify_pull.py` | Exports authorized Spotify library snapshot to `data/spotify/spotify_library.json`. |
| Local-match join | `automation/spotify_local_match.py` | Joins Spotify library against `data/library_index/library_index.json` to identify which streamed tracks also exist locally. |
| Gap report | `automation/spotify_gap_report.py` | Produces `data/manifests/spotify_missing_tracks.txt` for tracks present on Spotify but missing from the local FLAC library. |
| Indexer (upstream dependency) | `automation/music_indexer.py` | Scans `\\NAS87828E\Music` for FLAC. Must run before `spotify_local_match.py`. Indexer exclusion rules live in `config/music_sources.json`. |

Snapshot as saved 2026-05-12. Authoritative for redirect URIs, API surface, and registration metadata.

### 7.1 Basic Information

| Field | Value |
|---|---|
| App name | The Audiopheliac |
| App description | Personal music intelligence system that links local FLAC libraries, Spotify data, and Discogs collections to enable analysis, matching, and automated playlist generation for The Audiopheliac project. |
| Website | theaudiopheliac.com |
| Client ID | `7b8b0cd38be7496b864a0380b8c2a16c` |
| Status | Development mode |
| Dashboard | https://developer.spotify.com/dashboard/7b8b0cd38be7496b864a0380b8c2a16c |

### 7.2 Redirect URIs

| URI | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `http://127.0.0.1:5000/spotify/callback` | Audiopheliac Cockpit (Flask app on GDMARCHE, console/app.py) |
| `http://127.0.0.1:8888/callback` | Audiopheliac automation pipeline (`automation/spotify_pull.py` and downstream scripts). Matches `SPOTIFY_REDIRECT_URI` in `config/spotify.env`. Verified 2026-05-12. |

### 7.3 Bundle IDs / Native packages

| Surface | Value |
|---|---|
| iOS app bundles | (none registered) |
| Android packages | (none registered) |

### 7.4 APIs / SDKs enabled

| Surface | Enabled | Use case |
|---|---|---|
| Web API | Yes | Cockpit playback control (search, playlists, transport, devices, transfer) via spotipy; automation pipeline (`automation/spotify_pull.py`) |
| Web Playback SDK | Yes | Reserved for future browser-as-Spotify-Connect-device use (e.g., theaudiopheliac.com player, Cockpit-as-endpoint). Premier required, no code against it yet. |
| Ads API | No | Not relevant |
| iOS SDK | No | No native iOS app planned |
| Android SDK | No | No native Android app planned |

### 7.5 Secrets and credentials

| Item | Location |
|---|---|
| Client secret (canonical) | `config/spotify.env` (gitignored). Single source of truth; consumed by both the automation pipeline and the Cockpit. |
| Client secret (optional Cockpit override) | `console/spotify_secret.json` (gitignored). If present, takes precedence over `config/spotify.env`. Template at `console/spotify_secret.example.json`. Use only if you want a separate secret scoped to the Cockpit. |
| Token cache (pipeline scripts) | Per-script local cache (varies); see `automation/spotify_pull.py` |
| Token cache (Cockpit) | `console/spotify_token.json` (gitignored), managed by spotipy `SpotifyOAuth` |
| Authorized users | gillon.marchetti@gmail.com, gillon.marchetti@veterananalytics.com |

### 7.6 OAuth scopes (Cockpit)

Requested by `console/spotify.py`:

```
user-read-playback-state
user-modify-playback-state
user-read-currently-playing
user-read-private
user-library-read
playlist-read-private
playlist-read-collaborative
```

### 7.7 OAuth state nonce

The Codex security audit (2026-05-12) flagged the absence of an explicit `state` nonce check in `console/app.py`'s `/spotify/callback` handler. Investigated and intentionally not duplicated at the app layer: `spotipy.SpotifyOAuth.get_authorize_url()` generates a per-flow `state` parameter and `get_access_token()` validates it against the local cache before returning a token. The Cockpit calls `sp.exchange_code(code)` which routes through `get_access_token()`. No additional Cockpit-layer code required. Logged here so a future reader does not re-flag.

### 7.8 CSRF + Host allowlist (Codex audit 2026-05-12)

A per-process CSRF token is generated at Flask start (`secrets.token_urlsafe(32)`) and rendered into `index.html` as `<meta name="cockpit-csrf">`. All `POST`/`PUT`/`PATCH`/`DELETE` requests must echo the token in an `X-Cockpit-CSRF` header and originate from `127.0.0.1:5000` or `localhost:5000`. Defense against DNS rebinding and cross-site form submissions targeting the local control surface. Token resets on Flask restart; existing browser tabs surface a "session expired, reload" toast on the resulting 403.

## 8. Troubleshooting Runbook

### Issue: AIR Hub default format reverts between Spotify tracks or after Spotify restart
- **Symptom:** Audio plays bit-perfect on the first track, then sounds different on the next track or after closing and reopening Spotify. Windows Sound Advanced tab shows the format has changed away from 16-bit / 44.1 kHz.
- **Cause:** Windows USB audio drivers can renegotiate sample rate when an audio session ends and a new one begins. M-Audio AIR Hub firmware prefers 24-bit / 96 kHz at the hardware level, so without an app holding the device, the driver can pull rank during negotiation.
- **Fix:** Launch Spotify only via the `Spotify_Bit_Perfect.lnk` shortcut, which runs `Set-AIRHub-And-Launch-Spotify.ps1`. The wrapper re-pins the default format every session.
- **Verification:** After launching via the shortcut, open `Control Panel > Sound > AIR Hub > Properties > Advanced` and confirm "16 bit, 44100 Hz (CD Quality)" is shown. Play three consecutive tracks. Format must remain pinned.

### Issue: Spotify plays through the wrong output device
- **Symptom:** Audio routes to Yamaha R-N800A, Bose Lifestyle 650, or another endpoint instead of the AIR Hub.
- **Cause:** Spotify Connect can hand off playback to any device on the LAN that advertises itself as a Spotify endpoint, or Windows default playback device may not be set to the AIR Hub.
- **Fix:**
  1. In Spotify, click the device selector (bottom right of the now-playing bar) and select "This computer".
  2. Confirm the AIR Hub is the Windows default playback device. Run `& 'C:\Tools\SoundVolumeView\SoundVolumeView.exe' /SetDefault 'M-Audio AIR Hub' all 1` from PowerShell 5.1, or relaunch via the bit-perfect shortcut.
- **Verification:** Sound icon system tray should show the AIR Hub as the active output. Audio should be heard through the HS7 monitors via the MX28.

### Issue: Local Files not appearing in Spotify library
- **Symptom:** Tracks under `M:\The Audiopheliac\First Tracks\` do not show in Spotify's Local Files view.
- **Cause:** Spotify indexes only MP3 (not WAV) from Local Files sources. M: drive mapping may also be offline.
- **Fix:**
  1. Verify M: mapping is live: `Test-Path 'M:\The Audiopheliac\First Tracks\'`. If false, remap with `net use M: "\\NAS87828E\Music" /persistent:yes`.
  2. Confirm MP3 versions exist alongside WAV files. Spotify will only show MP3.
  3. In Spotify, toggle Settings > Library > Show songs from `M:\The Audiopheliac` off and on. Reindex.
- **Verification:** MP3 tracks appear under Your Library > Local Files.

### Issue: `automation/spotify_pull.py` returns 401 Unauthorized
- **Symptom:** Pipeline script fails with 401 or "token expired" error.
- **Cause:** OAuth refresh token is expired or revoked, or Client ID / secret has been rotated.
- **Fix:**
  1. Verify `config/spotify.env` contains current `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID` and `SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET`.
  2. Re-run the OAuth flow per the script's auth bootstrap (see comments inside `automation/spotify_pull.py`).
  3. Confirm the authorized account is still listed under the Spotify Developer App's User Management page.
- **Verification:** `python automation\spotify_pull.py` writes a fresh `data/spotify/spotify_library.json` without errors.

### Issue: Spotify quality silently downgrades
- **Symptom:** Lossless icon disappears from the now-playing bar, or audio quality audibly drops.
- **Cause:** Spotify may downgrade quality on transient network issues if Auto Adjust Quality is on, or the account tier may have lapsed.
- **Fix:**
  1. Confirm Settings > Audio Quality > Auto Adjust Quality is OFF.
  2. Confirm Streaming Quality is set to Lossless.
  3. Verify Premier subscription is current at https://www.spotify.com/account/subscription/.
- **Verification:** Lossless badge visible on the now-playing bar during playback of a track from a verified lossless album.

## 9. Known Limitations

- Spotify desktop on Windows does not support native ASIO or WASAPI Exclusive Mode. Bit-perfect playback requires the Windows shared-mode default format to be locked at 16-bit / 44.1 kHz with no enhancements and no resampling.
- Spotify Local Files indexes MP3 only; WAV files are ignored (vendor limitation, not a configuration error).
- Spotify Developer App is in Development mode and capped at 5 authorized users. Promoting to Extended Quota requires Spotify's review process.
- No official public Suno API exists, so Suno > Spotify cross-platform automation is not viable through Spotify's Developer surface.
- M-Audio AIR Hub bit-depth is fixed at 24-bit by hardware; not a Spotify-side concern, but worth noting when interpreting the playback chain.
