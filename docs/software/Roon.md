# Software Package Configuration Profile - Roon

> **DEPRECATED 2026-05-18.** Roon trial was cancelled before the subscription kicked in. Roon did not meet The Audiopheliac's playback purposes and is officially out. This profile is retained as historical archive only; do NOT use it as a guide for current setup or troubleshooting. The active library/playback path is MinimServer (UPnP/DLNA) serving `\\NAS87828E\Music` to the R-N800A. See `CLAUDE.md` §HISTORY entry dated 2026-05-18 for the rationale and §HARDWARE for the current media-server posture. The Roon Docker container, Bridge service, Remote app, and `console/roon.py` integration in the Cockpit are queued for explicit removal under the OPEN ACTION ITEMS table in CLAUDE.md.

## 1. Overview

Roon is the library, search, browse, and playback brain for The Audiopheliac. Roon Server runs as a Docker container on the QNAP TS-473A and indexes the local FLAC/MP3 library on `\\NAS87828E\Music`. Roon Remote (desktop app) on GDMARCHE is the operator UI. Roon Bridge runs as a Windows service on GDMARCHE to expose the M-Audio AIR Hub as a Roon endpoint zone for studio monitoring. The Yamaha R-N800A is enabled as an AirPlay 2 zone for Family Room playback. The Audiopheliac Cockpit (`console/`) authenticates as a Roon extension and drives library + playback through the Roon API; YXC stays in service for receiver-side controls (power, volume, source select, transport, Net Radio presets).

Hardware references: `docs/av_master_inventory_2026.md` (NAS, GDMARCHE, R-N800A, AIR Hub). Topology: `config/audiopheliac_signal_map_v_2026_05.md` (local, gitignored).

## 4. Configuration

### Roon Server (Docker container)

Compose file at `/share/Container/RoonServer/docker-compose.yml`:

| Setting | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| `image` | `ghcr.io/roonlabs/roonserver:latest` | Roon Labs official image, production tag |
| `network_mode` | `host` | Required for Roon's mDNS/SSDP discovery; bridged mode breaks zone discovery silently |
| `ROON_INSTALL_BRANCH` | `production` | Stable channel; switch to `earlyaccess` deliberately and only after backup |
| `TZ` | `America/New_York` | Local timezone for scheduled tasks and logs |
| Volume `/share/Container/RoonServer:/Roon` | rw | Roon database, settings, identity, logs |
| Volume `/share/Music:/Music` | rw (Roon docs say can be ro; left rw for index/metadata writes) | Library scan source |
| Volume `/share/Container/roon-backups:/RoonBackups` | rw | Roon-driven backup target |
| Volume `/run/udev:/run/udev:ro` | ro | udev events for device discovery |
| `cap_add` | `SYS_ADMIN`, `DAC_READ_SEARCH` | Roon's audio/file access requirements per generator |
| `security_opt` | `apparmor:unconfined`, `label:disable` | QNAP Container Station compatibility |
| `devices` | `/dev/snd`, `/dev/bus/usb` | USB / audio passthrough |
| `devices` (DELETED) | `/dev/dri` | TS-473A's Ryzen V1500B exposes no iGPU; `/dev/dri` is an empty dir, not a device node, and Docker rejects the passthrough. Roon runs fine without it for headless network playback. |
| `group_add` | `audio` | required for `/dev/snd` access |
| `restart` | `unless-stopped` | Survives QNAP reboots |
| `logging.driver` | `local` | Default Docker logging |

### Roon Server (in-app settings, set via Roon Remote at first run)

| Setting (Settings >) | Value | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Storage > Music folders | `/Music` (container path mapping `/share/Music`) | The local FLAC/MP3 library |
| Storage > Backups | `/RoonBackups` (container path mapping `/share/Container/roon-backups`) | Backup destination |
| Setup > Library Loading | (default) | First-run scan of 13,450 tracks completed cleanly |
| Audio > System Output (GDMARCHE) | Disabled | Routes through Windows mixer; non-bit-perfect; replaced by AIR HUB ASIO |
| Audio > M-Audio AIR HUB ASIO (GDMARCHE) | Enabled, named "The Audiopheliac Library" | Studio monitoring path: GDMARCHE > AIR Hub > MX28 > HS7 |
| Audio > AirPlay > Yamaha Receiver | Enabled, named "The Audiopheliac Library" | Family Room: Roon > AirPlay 2 > R-N800A > Polk ES60 |
| Backups (recommended, not yet scheduled) | Weekly to `/RoonBackups` | Roon DB recovery; queue for after trial decision |

### Zone naming convention (locked 2026-05-12)

Seven Roon outputs are enabled and named per the table below. The Cockpit's `preferred_zones` config filters the displayed zones to four room prefixes via substring match ("Family Room", "Studio", "Lanai", "Master Bedroom"), so any output prefixed with one of these strings appears in the Cockpit UI.

| Zone name | Protocol | Endpoint / IP | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Family Room — Yamaha | AirPlay 2 | 192.168.1.191 | Primary Family Room playback path via R-N800A → Polk ES60 |
| Family Room — Bose | AirPlay 2 | 192.168.1.102 | Bose Lifestyle 650 console |
| Family Room — Shield | Chromecast | 192.168.1.250 | NVIDIA Shield Pro |
| Family Room — TV | Chromecast | 192.168.1.5 | Samsung NU6950 |
| Studio · AIR HUB | ASIO (via Roon Bridge) | GDMARCHE | M-Audio AIR Hub, bit-perfect studio monitoring |
| Lanai - TV | Chromecast | 192.168.1.239 | Primary Lanai endpoint (Samsung UN65U7900FD) |
| Master Bedroom | Chromecast / AirPlay 2 | 192.168.1.154 | Same hardware exposes both protocols; either is addressable |

The Cockpit's `console/config.json` pins the displayed set with:

```json
"preferred_zones": ["Family Room", "Studio", "Lanai", "Master Bedroom"]
```

`app.py` exposes this list at `GET /api/config` for the browser UI to filter the zone selector.

### Out-of-Roon rooms

- **Garage** — no Roon endpoint. Phone Bluetooth or Yamaha R-N800A Bluetooth only. The Bose SoundTouch Genius in the garage is not on the network as a Roon-addressable device.
- **Lanai (secondary path)** — the legacy wireless route remains live as a downstream of `Family Room — Yamaha`: Yamaha PRE OUT → Rolls MB15b → 1Mii TX → Lanai 1Mii RX → Schiit SYS → Bose 3·2·1 AUX IN. Roon does not see this path; it is driven by whatever the Family Room Yamaha is playing. The Roon-primary Lanai endpoint is `Lanai - TV` (192.168.1.239) via Chromecast.

### Roon Bridge (GDMARCHE)

Headless service, no UI. Service registration verified via:

```powershell
Get-Service -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*Roon*" }
```

Should return `Roon Bridge` (or similar) with `Status: Running`, `StartType: Automatic`.

### Roon Remote (GDMARCHE)

Desktop UI. No persistent settings worth capturing here; all real config is server-side.

---

## 5. Signal Chain / Integration Points

### Family Room (AirPlay zone)

```
Roon Server (NAS Docker) > AirPlay 2 (LAN) > Yamaha R-N800A > Polk ES60 (Speaker A)
```

The R-N800A's AirPlay 2 service is auto-enabled when on the network; no MusicCast or front-panel toggle exists for it. Sample rate is fixed at 44.1 kHz over AirPlay; Roon will resample anything higher.

### Studio (AIR HUB ASIO zone)

```
Roon Server (NAS Docker) > Roon Bridge (GDMARCHE Windows service) > M-Audio AIR Hub ASIO > Rolls MX28 > Yamaha HS7 + JBL LSR310S
```

ASIO is exclusive-access. When Roon holds the AIR Hub via ASIO, Spotify desktop, Ableton, Audacity, browser audio cannot use it simultaneously. Switch to WASAPI for Roon if simultaneous use is needed (trade: WASAPI is shared-mode through the Windows mixer, no longer bit-perfect).

### Cockpit integration

```
Browser (UI) > Flask app.py > roon.py (RoonClient) > roonapi (Python lib) > Roon Core extension protocol > Roon Server
```

The Cockpit registers as a Roon extension named "Audiopheliac Cockpit" with extension_id `com.audiopheliac.cockpit`. First-run authorization requires user approval in Roon → Settings → Extensions. Token persists at `console/roon_token.json` (gitignored).

### What Roon does NOT touch

YXC (receiver) controls remain on the Yamaha YXC client (`console/yamaha.py`). The Cockpit calls YXC for: power on/off, volume, mute, source select, transport (Spotify Connect / Net Radio when Yamaha is the active source rather than a Roon-driven playback path), Net Radio preset recall.

## 6. Related Automation

| Artifact | Path | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| docker-compose.yml | `/share/Container/RoonServer/docker-compose.yml` (NAS) | Roon Server container definition |
| docker-compose.yml (working copy) | `C:\Users\gillo\Downloads\docker-compose.yml` (GDMARCHE) | Pre-deploy edit copy; canonical source on NAS |
| Cockpit Roon client | `console/roon.py` | RoonClient class wrapping `roonapi`; library, search, browse, transport |
| Cockpit Flask routes | `console/app.py` `@app.route("/api/roon/*")` | HTTP surface to the browser UI |
| Token cache | `console/roon_token.json` | Roon extension auth token; gitignored |
| Pip dependency | `console/requirements.txt` `roonapi>=0.1.6` | Python wrapper for Roon API |

## 7. Troubleshooting Runbook

### Issue: Roon Server container won't start (device passthrough error)
- **Symptom:** `docker compose up -d` reports `error gathering device information while adding custom device "/dev/dri": not a device node`
- **Cause:** Roon's compose generator assumed iGPU-equipped hardware. TS-473A's AMD Ryzen V1500B has no exposed iGPU; `/dev/dri` is an empty directory, not a device node.
- **Fix:** Remove the `- /dev/dri:/dev/dri` line from the `devices:` block in docker-compose.yml. `docker compose down` then `docker compose up -d`.
- **Verification:** `docker ps --filter name=roonserver` shows `Up X seconds`.

### Issue: "This PC" section missing from Roon Audio settings
- **Symptom:** Roon Settings > Audio shows Roon Tested + Other network devices, but no "This PC" section listing GDMARCHE outputs (AIR HUB, Realtek, etc.)
- **Cause:** Roon Bridge service on GDMARCHE is not running, or was never installed. The Roon desktop Remote app provides endpoint capability while open, but it disappears when Remote closes or disconnects.
- **Fix:** Verify with `Get-Service -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Where-Object { $_.Name -like "*Roon*" }`. If empty, install Roon Bridge from https://roonlabs.com/downloads as Administrator. If present but Stopped, `Get-Service "Roon Bridge" | Start-Service`.
- **Verification:** "This PC" section reappears in Roon Settings > Audio after refresh (top-right circular arrow).

### Issue: "Device initialization failed" on AIR HUB ASIO row
- **Symptom:** Red error on the `M-Audio AIR HUB ASIO` row in Roon Settings > Audio. Won't play.
- **Cause:** Most often, ASIO contention (another app holds the driver: Ableton, Audacity, Spotify launcher routing through AIR Hub). Sometimes stale Roon state from a prior dock-undock cycle.
- **Fix:** (1) Close Ableton, Audacity, Spotify desktop, and any browser playing audio. (2) Click gear on the AIR HUB ASIO row > Disable > wait 3 s > Enable. (3) If still failing: `Get-Service "Roon Bridge" | Restart-Service`.
- **Verification:** Roon plays a track; AIR Hub Driver Control Panel shows "Streaming."

### Issue: Cockpit shows "Roon: discovering..." indefinitely
- **Symptom:** Top bar of `http://localhost:5000` shows discovering or waiting_for_auth and never connects.
- **Cause:** First-run extension authorization not completed.
- **Fix:** Open Roon Remote > Settings > Extensions. Find "Audiopheliac Cockpit" listed as pending. Click Enable. Token saves to `console/roon_token.json`.
- **Verification:** Top bar flips to `Roon: <core_name>`; Roon Zone card lists active zones.

### Issue: Cockpit Roon connection drops after working
- **Symptom:** Top bar flips to "Roon: error" or "Roon: discovering" mid-session
- **Cause:** Roon Server container restart, network blip, or the `roonapi` connection timed out
- **Fix:** Wait 10 s for auto-reconnect. If persistent, restart Flask: `Get-Process pythonw, python -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue | Stop-Process -Force` then `python app.py` from `C:\Users\gillo\6. The-Audiopheliac\console`.
- **Verification:** Top bar returns to `Roon: <core_name>`.

## 8. Known Limitations

- **No /dev/dri on TS-473A:** Removed from compose file. Roon's video/album-art codec acceleration falls back to CPU. Negligible impact for headless network playback.
- **R-N800A AirPlay 2 sample rate cap:** AirPlay 2 caps at 44.1 kHz / 16-bit. Higher-res files in the library get resampled by Roon for the Family Room zone. Studio (AIR HUB ASIO) is not affected; native sample rates pass through.
- **ASIO exclusivity on AIR Hub:** Only one app can hold the ASIO driver at a time. Concurrent use of Roon + Spotify (via launcher) + Ableton on the AIR Hub is not possible without switching some clients to WASAPI.
- **Roon Server database on spinning HDD:** The TS-473A has no SSD slot for the Roon database. Performance on the 12TB WD Red is workable but not optimal. Roon's official guidance recommends SSD; a USB 3.0 SSD upgrade is the cheap fix if Roon is kept past trial. Search and library page loads will be sluggish until then.
- **Roon on this firmware does not expose Yamaha R-N800A tone control via YXC.** Tone (bass/treble) and Pure Direct stay receiver-side, controlled via the front panel or MusicCast Controller. See `docs/software/Yamaha-RN800A.md` §8.
- **Trial expires 2026-05-25.** Subscription auto-renews at $149.88/yr unless cancelled at https://account.roon.app/account/manage-billing.

## 9. Change Log

| Date | Profile version | Change |
|---|---|---|
| 2026-05-11 | 2026.05.1 | Initial profile. Roon Server deployed via Docker on QNAP TS-473A (replacing failed 2023 community QPKG). Library scan completed (13,450 tracks). Roon Bridge installed on GDMARCHE. Two zones enabled (AirPlay > R-N800A; AIR HUB ASIO via Bridge). Cockpit pivoted from YXC-only to Roon-backed library + playback; YXC retained for receiver controls. |
| 2026-05-12 | 2026.05.2 | Zone naming convention locked. Seven Roon outputs renamed: `Family Room — Yamaha` / `— Bose` / `— Shield` / `— TV`, `Studio · AIR HUB`, `Lanai - TV`, `Master Bedroom`. Cockpit `preferred_zones` set to the four room prefixes (`Family Room`, `Studio`, `Lanai`, `Master Bedroom`). Master Bedroom newly identified as a Roon-addressable zone (Chromecast + AirPlay 2 at 192.168.1.154). Lanai gains a primary Roon endpoint at 192.168.1.239; legacy 1Mii wireless path retained as secondary. |
