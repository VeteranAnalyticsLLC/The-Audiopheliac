# AV_Master_Inventory_v2026.05.3

**The Audiopheliac – Comprehensive AV, Studio & Network Inventory**  
Author & Maintainer: *Gillon "Gill" Marchetti (MarcArmy2003)*  
Version: v2026.05.3  
Date: May 30, 2026  
Last change: Session 4 + 5 audio-infrastructure consolidation. (1) Added MOTU M4 as the active primary audio interface of record (installed 2026-05-28; replaced the failed Focusrite Scarlett Solo; restores ADC / recording capability). (2) Demoted M-Audio AIR Hub to cold spare (30-day evaluation through 2026-06-27). (3) Rebuilt the Studio Monitoring Chain and Interface Status block around the M4. (4) Added a Front Panel Reference subsection for the MOTU M4 and Rolls MX28, with operational mapping aligned to the post-AIR-Hub gain-staging doctrine (M4 MAIN + source are the daily controls; MX28 MASTER sits at reference). (5) Confirmed AT-VM95SH Shibata cartridge installed on the AT-LP120XUSB (Session 4). Prior v2026.05.2 reconciled the Schiit pair (Mani II = Office Studio phono preamp; SYS relocated to Lanai).

AIR Hub Powered USB-A Hub (USB peripherals only, no audio routing):
  • Audio-Technica AT-LP120XUSB (USB-A — host-side digital, separate from line-out audio path)
  • Positive Grid Spark 40 (USB-A)
  • Casio Privia PX-870WE (USB-A)
```

**Interface Status (2026-05-28):**
- MOTU M4 — **PRIMARY** audio interface of record (installed 2026-05-28). USB-C, 24-bit/192kHz, MOTU M Series ASIO. 2× combo XLR/TRS mic/line in + 48V phantom; line inputs 3-4 reserved for the Mani II vinyl-rip path. MONITOR outs → MX28 LEVEL 3 BAL.
- M-Audio AIR Hub — **COLD SPARE** (30-day evaluation through 2026-06-27). Output only (no ADC); retained as known-good fallback / USB-A passthrough hub.
- Focusrite Scarlett Solo 4th Gen — **FAILED** (2026-05-11), moved to Stored / Inactive. Warranty attempt pending.
- Rolls MX28 Mini-Mix VI — **CENTRAL MIXER**, sums M4 (DAW/playback) + LP120 (via Mani II) + 1Mii RX to the monitor chain. Used for recording-session mixing and loop capture.
- Recording capability **RESTORED** with the M4 (mic/instrument inputs + ADC), replacing the output-only AIR Hub interim.

**Schiit pair status (resolved 2026-05-11):**
- **Schiit Mani II** stays in Office Studio as the phono preamp for AT-LP120XUSB. LP120 set to PHONO out → Mani II → MX28 Input B.
- **Schiit SYS** relocated to Lanai. Now serves as a passive A/B switch between the 1Mii RX #2 (Family Room wireless) and the Singing Machine (karaoke), feeding the Bose 3·2·1 AUX IN.

### 🎚 Front Panel Reference — MOTU M4 and Rolls MX28 (stacked: MX28 on top of M4)

**MOTU M4 — Front Panel (left to right):**
- IN 1L: combo XLR/TRS jack, GAIN knob, 48V phantom pad, MON (monitor) button — Mic/Line/Guitar
- IN 2R: combo XLR/TRS jack, GAIN knob, 48V phantom pad, MON button — Mic/Line/Guitar
- INPUT <-> PLAYBACK monitor mix knob, with 3-4 channel button below
- LCD metering display: IN (channels 1-2, 3-4) and OUT (channels 1-2, 3-4), color-gradient level bars
- MAIN (monitor output) volume knob — large, right of center
- Headphone output: 1/4" jack with level control (far right)

**Rolls MX28 Stereo Mini-Mix VI — Front Panel (left to right):**
- LEVEL 1 BAL knob
- LEVEL 2 BAL knob
- LEVEL 3 BAL knob
- MASTER LEVEL knob
- HEADPHONE LEVEL knob
- Green power LED (between Master and Headphone knobs)
- Headphone outputs: 1/4" jack + 1/8" jack (below right knobs)
- Rear (per top-panel label): Inputs 1/2/3 each L/R RCA, OUTPUT L/R RCA, DC IN (VDC)

**Operational mapping (per current gain-staging doctrine — post-AIR-Hub, MOTU M4 era):**
- Source level (Spotify, DAW master, Mani II gain stop) = manages healthy signal at origin
- MOTU M4 MAIN knob = daily volume for speaker playback through the MX28
- MOTU M4 headphone knob = daily volume for headphone monitoring (independent of MAIN)
- MX28 MASTER LEVEL = set once at reference and left alone (it was the daily control during the AIR Hub interim, when the AIR Hub's own volume knob was unreliable; with the M4 in place that role returns to the M4 + source side of the chain)
- MX28 headphone out = reserved for blended multi-source monitoring

| ------------ | -------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **v2026.05.3** | May 30, 2026 | **AUDIO INFRASTRUCTURE CONSOLIDATION (Sessions 4 + 5):** Added MOTU M4 as the active primary audio interface of record (installed 2026-05-28; replaced the failed Scarlett Solo; restores ADC / recording). Demoted M-Audio AIR Hub to cold spare (evaluation through 2026-06-27). Rebuilt the Studio Monitoring Chain (Source 1 is now the M4) and the Interface Status block around the M4. Added a Front Panel Reference subsection for the MOTU M4 + Rolls MX28, with operational mapping aligned to the post-AIR-Hub gain-staging doctrine (M4 MAIN + source are the daily controls; MX28 MASTER sits at reference). Confirmed the AT-VM95SH Shibata cartridge installed on the AT-LP120XUSB (Session 4 doc pass). Resolved the Open Item "Replacement audio interface (with ADC)." |
| **v2026.05.2** | May 11, 2026 | **SCHIIT RECONCILIATION (per user verification):** Schiit Mani II confirmed active in Office Studio as the phono preamp for AT-LP120XUSB; LP120 set to PHONO out, Mani II RCA out → Rolls MX28 Input B. Schiit SYS relocated to Lanai as a passive A/B switch between 1Mii RX #2 (Family Room wireless) and Singing Machine (karaoke), output feeding Bose 3·2·1 AUX IN. Inventory Office Studio table: SYS row removed (now on Lanai). Inventory Lanai table: SYS row added. Studio Monitoring Chain: LP120 path corrected to LP120 → Mani II → MX28. Lanai signal chain: SYS switching block inserted before Bose AUX IN. Open Items: removed Schiit Mani II + SYS verification entry (resolved). |
| v2026.05.1 | May 11, 2026 | **STALENESS RECONCILIATION (per user verification):** (1) Added Rolls MX28 Mini-Mix VI to Home Office / Studio table — central studio mixer with three line inputs (AIR Hub TRS L/R, AT-LP120XUSB line out, 1Mii RX #1). (2) Rebuilt Studio Monitoring Chain to route AIR Hub + LP120 + 1Mii RX → MX28 → JBL LSR310S → HS7. (3) Promoted 1Mii RT5066R2 TX (Family Room) and both RXes to ACTIVE status. (4) Moved 1Mii RT5066R2 RX #2 from Garage table to Lanai table — actually lives on Lanai. (5) Retired SVS SoundPath TX and RX from active chains to Stored / Inactive — removed from signal chain months ago, replaced by 1Mii system. (6) Updated Family Room signal chain to show Yamaha Line Out → Rolls MB15b → 1Mii TX → RX in Office Studio + RX on Lanai. (7) Updated Lanai signal chain to replace SVS RX block with 1Mii RX block. (8) Removed obsolete "Planned Integration" footers for 1Mii (now actually integrated). **Open verification:** Schiit Mani II / Schiit SYS role in current Studio chain is unclear with LP120 feeding MX28 directly. |
| v2026.05     | May 11, 2026   | **CHANGES:** Focusrite Scarlett Solo 4th Gen marked **FAILED** (fried; no signal). Removed from active Studio chain; moved to Stored/Inactive. Receipt missing — warranty attempt planned but assumed lost. M-Audio AIR Hub (AIRXHUB) promoted from spare to **PRIMARY** monitoring/playback interface. Documented full AIR Hub spec: USB-C device to USB-A host (WD19DCS), 24-bit/96kHz DAC, 2× balanced 1/4" TRS monitor outs, 1× 1/4" headphone (independent level), 3× powered USB-A hub ports (LP120, Spark 40, Privia). AIR Hub is output-only (no ADC); recording capability offline until input-capable replacement is sourced. Updated Studio Monitoring Chain and Network Topology accordingly. |
| v2026.04     | Jan 19, 2026   | **CHANGES:** Confirmed Technics SL-1200MK2 in Family Room (Ortofon Blue). Moved AT-LP120XUSB to Studio (stock AT95E; AT-VM95SH Shibata on backorder, $219). Moved QNAP TS-473A to Family Room. Added Rolls MB15b, 1Mii RT5066R2 TX (Family Room), 1Mii RX #1 (Studio), 1Mii RX #2 (Garage). Moved Bose 3·2·1 to Lanai. Moved Amazon Echo to Garage. Added SVS SoundPath TX/RX routing (Family Room → Lanai). Added REI UHD-PRO102 HDMI splitter, J-Tech AE4KA, Mini AV upscaler to Lanai signal chain. Updated signal chains for all zones. Removed Blue Yeti mic, Rode boom arm, Zoom pedal (fabrications). **PENDING:** 1Mii connection method, AT-VM95SH delivery. |
| v2026.03     | Jan 16, 2026   | Relocated AT-LP120XUSB to Family Room (Ortofon Blue). Updated Casio PX-870WE serial. Added TP-Link TL-SG105 switch, APC Back-UPS 1000, Spectrum router SAX2V1R. Added Victrola VTA-71 to Bedrooms. Validated Seagull SC-6W and Pro-Ject serials. Updated Yamaha R-N800A speaker config (Zone A only). **PENDING:** Technics SL-1200MK2 location. |
| v2026.02     | Jan 16, 2026   | Added: MacBook Pro (2012 Kids' Unit), M-Audio Air\|HUB, JBL LSR310S, Yamaha HS7 verified SNs, Sansui ES-27X3A dual monitors, Dell Latitude 5340, HyperDrive Dock, LiftMaster MyQ Garage Opener. |
| v2026.01     | Jan 15, 2026   | Initial merge of v2025.12 with verified 2026 signal map.                                                                                                                                                         |
| v2025.12     | Dec 22, 2025   | Unified edition, all verified Amazon & Guitar Center purchases (Jan–Nov 2025) integrated.                                                                                                                       |
